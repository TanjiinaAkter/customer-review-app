# Online Shop Experience Review App

A simple React app that allows users to submit, view, edit, and delete reviews about their online shopping experiences. Reviews are saved in `localStorage` to persist across page reloads.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository and run `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. Run `npm start` to launch the app in development mode.

## Time Taken

Approximately 9 hours.

## What I Would Improve Given More Time

- Add form validation for better user input handling.
- Enhance UI/UX with more polished styling and animations.
